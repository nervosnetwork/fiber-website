# Official Website for Fiber Network

This is the official website for [Fiber Network](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber). The frontend is created from the [Astro Starter Kit](https://docs.astro.build/).

Fiber is a programmable P2P Finance network, scaling Satoshi's P2P Ecash Vision. It includes the following features:

- **Multiple assets support**, e.g. stable coins, RGB++ assets issued on Bitcoin ledger, and UDT assets issued on CKB ledger;
- **Extremely low-cost micropayments**, e.g. 0.0001 cent payment with 0.00000001 cent fee;
- **Instant swap between any asset pairs**, as long as there's available channel paths;
- **Cross-network asset payment/swap**, e.g. from Lightning network to Fiber network, and vice versa;
- **Watchtower support**, make it easier for node operators;
- **Multi-hop payment**, anyone can facilitate payments and earn payment fees by running a fiber node and becoming a hop on payment paths;
- **Low latency**, e.g. 0.0001 cent payment in your p2p connection latency, e.g. 20ms;
- **High throughput**, because transactions are only processed by involved peers, no network consensus required;
- **High privacy**, your transactions are only seen by involved peers;
- **Based on more advanced cryptographic techniques** to ensure security and privacy, e.g. uses PTLC not HTLC;
- **Composable** with other contracts/scripts on CKB;
